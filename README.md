# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using machine learning techniques. 
Customer churn prediction helps telecom companies identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive actions to improve retention.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer will churn based on their usage behavior and service details.

## 📊 Dataset
- Telecom customer data including:
  - Demographics
  - Service subscriptions
  - Contract type
  - Monthly and total charges
- Target variable: `Churn` (Yes / No)

## ⚙️ Workflow
